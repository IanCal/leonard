Installation Instructions

Things should now compile. You need to have installed the cuda sdk, edit the makefile in the src directory to point to the main folder (needed to find a couple of directories).

The example code needs allegro to run, but the biggest issue currently is that the example will only work if you have a specific file type, showing a certain type of data, of a certain length. I'll be adding more examples as the code progresses to a full working rbm.

make should do what it needs to and generate a binary to run in the "bin" directory. It probably won't, but hey :)
